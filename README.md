## ðŸš€ About Me

My name is Victor Martin-Romo and I love Ruby,

Throughout my working life I have had the opportunity to work with many programming languages (Ruby, Java, Pl/sql, c#, Vb, php, Angular, Angular JS, others...) and development platforms (.Net , Oracle Forms, OutSystems), I have learned something from all of them and luckily I have always been able to work on Ruby on Rails projects.

The good thing about all this is that you gain experience and different visions of how to solve a problem or how technology forces us to solve it, the bad thing is that in none of these frameworks do I feel as free as with Ruby on Rails.

It is what it has to have tried it...

## ðŸ›  Skills
Javascript, HTML, CSS... to-do
